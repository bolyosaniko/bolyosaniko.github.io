First and foremost, I would like to share my writings and experiences, and inspire and motivate my readers. I draw from my soul, and for me this is also self-healing. And my main desire is to illustrate that it is not only theoretical knowledge that is necessary for our development, but also life experiences that can give us true wisdom. For we can only draw from what we have already experienced and drawn the right lessons. But I am also passionate about my vocation, which I would like to write about here.

I have always felt that I wanted to work with people, to help them with my heart and soul, both spiritually and rationally, as a soul helper. I have been part of a great journey to find my purpose in life. In 2016, I had to move to another country with my partner to find myself. It was one of the most decisive decisions of my life, because I discovered my true inner strength outside my comfort zone. I literally built my way up from minimal English, but of course there is always room for improvement now. In addition to my Hungarian guests, after a while I was joined by foreigners, from whom I can also learn a lot. Different ways of looking at the world, different cultures and mentalities that I can experience through them. What I have really learned is that every soul is unique and special, whom I approach with respect and love, regardless of their affiliation. I also learn a lot from my guests, and for that I am always grateful.

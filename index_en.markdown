    I underwent colour analysis with Anikó, and loved it. She was accurate, sensitive and very courteous.<br/><br/>
    I had a bespoke experience, and, as a result, Anikó helped me both personally and professionally. I came out reenergised, and with useful advice. I totally recommend her services.

    I'm not someone who trusts people easily with my inner feelings and thoughts, except when I meet someone with such a bright light that you feel like you've known each other for a long time. Anikó is such a person. First she was my English language student, then friend, and now my very talented spiritual coach. I'm lucky to have her in my life and highly recommended her services to anyone seeking some guidance and clarity from a competent and reliable person. Love you, Anikó 🥰🌹🥰

    Thank you so much for inviting me to this amazing page. Two years ago I would have just passed on this because I never believed in cards. But today, am all excited because of my personal experiences I’ve had with the cards, thanks to you. I hope everyone gets to give this a try even if it’s for curiosity sake. Love you ❤️

    I recently had a colour analysis consultation with Aniko. This was a completely new experience for me so I was very excited about the results. Aniko gave me a detailed analysis which was fully explained. It was spot on and gave me a real insight into my personality and really helped me. I would fully recommend it to anyone.

If you feel that you can't find your place in the world, often don't understand yourself or have difficulty making decisions, then this is the place for you!

Through self-awareness work you can learn more about yourself and your personality. This knowledge will make your everyday life easier by changing the way you see yourself. And this will affect all your human relationships. It all starts from within you, and it's up to you what you want to bring out of yourself. I can help you, but you have to take the next steps to change.

I am sure that you have your own unique life journey, and that the signposts have just pointed you in this direction. I welcome you here on my site!

We are all different, but we all have one thing in common: we all want to be loved and understood. I always do my work with all my heart, dedication and humility, and that is how I welcome my dear guests in person and online.

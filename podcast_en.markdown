For me, even small successes are a great gift. In order to be able to be unabashedly happy about everything that comes my way, or that comes as a surprise, I have to appreciate the success of each small step. Only in this way can we remain humble and have serenity in our hearts in this long spiritual evolution. And that includes being able to give others sincere, heartfelt joy. For it only lifts us up when it is good for others, not just for us. Rejoicing together, supporting one another, is one of the most uplifting feelings that can carry us through a difficult, bumpy road. Or the feeling that we can work together with others, that it's not just about the self, that I can achieve something. With others, we can also brainstorm, create and grow in a common mission. A sense of belonging can do wonders.

That's why my husband, Milán, and I started sharing our story in the form of podcasts, which might help those who would like to move abroad or are already living there, or those who are just curious about our shared spiritual evolution along the way. We've started on two threads: one is our full story from the beginning of our move to the present day, and the other is shorter recordings of the two of us exploring unrelated topics (but still related to my site). If you're interested, you can listen to our recordings on the platforms below.

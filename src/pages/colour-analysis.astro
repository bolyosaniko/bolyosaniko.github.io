        <NormalBlock title="What happens during a colour analysis session?">
            <p class="mb-3 md:mb-6">You arrive at the agreed time, and in a comfortable setting, we’ll start with a brief chat
                to understand how I can help you. We’ll go over the basics of colour theory so you know what to expect, and
                you’ll complete a personality quiz to guide us during the draping process. This quiz is not a rulebook but a
                helpful reference to align your personality with the colours that best support your current life phase.</p>
            <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-8 items-center">
                <div>
                    <p class="mb-3 md:mb-6">Next, we’ll move on to the practical part: the draping session. You’ll sit without
                        makeup in natural light, with your hair and clothing covered to ensure the focus is entirely on your
                        face. We’ll test various shades – warm and cool, vibrant and soft – to identify which colours enhance
                        your natural glow and which may make you appear tired. This process reveals the shades that make you
                        look youthful, fresh, and authentic, even without makeup.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3 md:mb-6">We’ll also determine whether gold or silver suits you better and explore which
                        jewellery and accessories complement your natural beauty. The goal isn’t to impose strict rules on
                        your wardrobe but to give you the freedom to mix and match colours confidently while highlighting
                        your personality.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="mb-3 md:mb-6">Throughout the session, we’ll discuss the psychological effects of colours, which can
                significantly influence your mood and emotions. The right colours boost confidence and positively impact
                those around you, supporting both your external appearance and inner well-being.</p>
            <p class="mb-3 md:mb-6">At the end of the consultation, you’ll receive tips on integrating your new colours into
                your existing wardrobe. We’ll discuss how to pair them and select pieces that align with your style. These
                new colours will not only enhance your growth journey but also inspire and uplift both you and those around
                you.</p>

                        <p>We base the analysis on your natural skin tone for the most accurate results. This way, we can see
                            which colours truly enhance your natural glow. You’re welcome to arrive with makeup, as you’ll have
                            the opportunity to remove it at the start of the session – feel free to bring your own products for
                            reapplication afterward. I’ll also share tips, especially for lipsticks.</p>

                        <p>Natural light ensures the most accurate results, as artificial lighting can distort colours. Therefore,
                            I conduct consultations exclusively in natural light: between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. during winter and from
                            9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in spring, summer, and autumn.</p>

                            have the chance to ask follow-up questions via email and attend a free follow-up session three months
                            later. Don’t rush the process – take your time exploring colours and styles, and you’ll gradually
                            become more confident. We can even incorporate your old favourite colours with small adjustments for
                            a more harmonious look.</p>

                        <p>Not at all! The consultation aims to show you the shades that suit you best, but it’s not about
                            restricting your style. I’ll teach you how to incorporate other colour types so they work for you.
                            The ultimate goal is for you to feel confident and authentic in what you wear – and I’m here to

                    Today I carried out a colour analysis with Anikó. She concluded I looked best in Spring colours. It was so worth it. It's an informative & fun session.
                </Card>
                <Card author="Linda Dalton">
                    Hi Anikó, I really enjoyed it this morning. I feel really inspired to try some new colour combinations. It was really helpful to see the colours working by using some of your own clothing, rather than just the swatches. And having the photos to refer to is absolutely brilliant. I appreciated your offer to help me with my wardrobe if I need it. Your suggestion about batching similar colours together in my wardrobe is a fantastic idea. I think I already had a reasonable idea of colours that suit me, but after today I’m definitely open to expanding my range. Thank you so much! You will undoubtedly be really successful when you start your own business as you are so warm, welcoming, enthusiastic and emotionally intelligent. 😘

                    Last Saturday, on 6th July, I had the lovely experience of learning a bit about the power of the colours and how they can boost my life. Anikó did an amazing job teaching and helping me to understand the impact of matching colours with my style.<br/>
                    I’m looking forward to applying all those learnings to my daily basis, and I wish all the best to Anikó on this journey that for sure will bring a lot of joy to people’s lives.

                    I had my colour analysis done by Aniko. The session began by having a white drape placed over my neck to cover my body. Next, she draped several colour fabric swatches over the white drape. Based on the tone of your natural skin tone, Aniko explained about the seasonal categories: Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. Using different ranges of colours, based on a season, Aniko pointed out the colours that complement and harmonize my skin complexion, my eyes and my hair colour too. I was happily surprised by my result as an Autumn person, as I really love the brown palette.<br/>
                    Not only has Aniko guided me on clothing, but she also showed me what jewellery colour choices and with very interesting information for makeup.<br/>
                    I truly recommend her. She is a highly professional, kind and warm person. She really put her heart on helping me to get the best version of myself.<br/>
                    I think a colour analysis with Aniko might be an awesome gift for someone too.

                    I have absolutely loved my color analysis with Aniko! I previously gravitated towards darker tones but she has shown me how they make me look older and how different tones can completely brighten up my complexion. I still wear my favourite colors just in the tones that suit me. We also determined that I suit gold jewellery better which I was really happy about because it was my preferred choice anyways. I am so happy I had the chance to try this out with Aniko, I definitely feel more confident dressing more colourful in my everyday life.

                    She is very professional and thorough with her job. Gives you tips and tricks on how to mix up the colours. Not the first time I used her services and definitely not the last!

                    I really enjoyed my colour analysis session. I wasn't confident in which colours suited me before. The session showed me that I should trust my instinct more. It was really striking to see examples of my best colours, which made me look more vibrant and alive, against other colours which just made me look tired. I am really looking forward to going through my wardrobe and experimenting with some colours I hadn't considered before. I would definitely recommend this service to anyone who wants to feel more confident in their colour choices.

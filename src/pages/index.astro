        <LandingBlock title="Discover the Magic of Colours – Inside and Out!">
            <p>Did you know that colours affect not only your appearance but also your inner world? As a colour consultant
                and interpreter, I help you discover the shades that not only enhance your natural beauty but also align
                with your personality, support your self-awareness journey, and help your well-being.</p>

    <LandingBlock title="What is a Colour Type?" bgClass="bg-pic-pantone">
        <p>Colour types inspired by the seasons – Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter – encompass unique combinations of
            shades that match your skin tone, hair colour, and eye colour. During a colour analysis, we use specialised
            drapes to determine your individual colour type, so you can choose clothes, makeup, and accessories that suit
            you perfectly.</p>

        <LandingBlock title="Colours That Speak Volumes...">
            <p>Colour analysis and colour interpretation are two distinct yet complementary services. While colour
                analysis focuses on your appearance, helping you identify the most flattering colours for clothing,
                makeup, and accessories, colour interpretation delves deeper. It’s a self-awareness method that uses the
                psychological effects of colours to explore your strengths, weaknesses, challenges in your current life
                phase, and unresolved issues from the past.</p>

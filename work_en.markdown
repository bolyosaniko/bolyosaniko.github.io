In my guidance, approached through a spiritual path, I offer help to my dear guests using Gypsy and Lenormand cards. Taking a more rational, yet intuitive approach, I also work with personalised colour analysis and the world of numbers also known as the science of numerology. Colours help to reveal our spiritual, physical and mental state. They show us what we brought with us, and the potential we have to consciously make our lives easier. Numerology also helps us to do this. It is one of the best ways of self-awareness to get a complete picture of our personality and the energies we bring with us from birth.

It is important to emphasize that the main goal is not only to map out the future, but also what decisions and steps we need to take in order to get to where we really want to be. Often we don't even see our human relationships clearly, although this is a very important part of our lives. The environment around us is crucial. We are in control of our lives and we have to make the right choices. This is where I can help, by using my objective perspective and insight to talk through what might be the optimal direction to take on a given issue. In many cases, the answer is already on the surface, just a confirmation, but very importantly, no prescription is needed. My main goal is to get people to see what they already really know and feel, but have not yet surfaced or are uncertain about the situation. Everyone has free will, the decision is in their own hands, and I respect that in all circumstances.

#### What is colour analysis exactly?

I once decided to colour my life by delving into the world of colour. Through much study, research and experience, I realised that I could help others. I have mastered a method to help us uncover what is going on in our souls and what we have been carrying with us for so long on our journey. Sometimes our souls are just waiting for confirmation, to finally say what we may have suspected but not taken seriously, even though the feeling is already there, almost shouting. The colours show it.

In everyday life, I simply let my soul tell me which colour I need. I feel that we can have a strong relationship with colour, if we just take the time to get to know it. If one is calling to you, but has never played a role in your life before, it means it's time to make a change, to add another colour to your day. They are part of our evolution, so it's worth watching ourselves to see which one appeals to us at each stage of our life, or during a major life change. Each of our chapters has its own colour scheme that takes us to the next.

And how can I help you with all this? All it takes is the creation of a light, playful, yet intuitive colouring. With the help of a web app my partner developed, this can be done remotely and based on the feedback so far, it absolutely works. I produce personalised colour analyses of the completed colouring in Hungarian and English. We can then discuss the message and suggestion of your colours and where you are at the moment spiritually, mentally and physically at an appointment, which takes about an hour and a half. The analysis itself will be emailed to you at the end of the consultation for you to read at any time. After all, there is too much information in such an analysis and not everything is remembered. Some of the messages may not be really understood until later. It's worth reading it several times, and taking it out of the drawer from time to time, even months later. Self-knowledge is a long-term process that requires persistent work.

Just getting started is difficult, but if we give ourselves the time and energy, we can work wonders. Just give yourself time, that's the most important thing. I only help, the rest is up to your own efforts, your will to change, to understand yourself.

Colouring can also be done remotely using a web application, which can be found [here](https://chroma-therapy.herokuapp.com/){:target="_blank"}.

I am at the disposal of my dear guests with confidence, who can find me in person in England or online through my website. I also undertake inquiries in English, in which case, based on pleasant experiences, the national border is not an obstacle either.

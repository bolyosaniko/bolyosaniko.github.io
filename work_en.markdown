Personally, I have been - and still am - on a journey of self-discovery. Thanks to this, I have found my vocation, my purpose in life - in other words, myself. That is why I emphasise self-awareness in my work: because that is where everything starts. You can really make a big step forward if you know where to go next.

Over the years, I've mastered a number of different methods and techniques, all of which I love to use in my face-to-face and online consultations, and I adapt them to the needs of my clients, depending on what they need most.

Whether it is a face-to-face or online consultation, it is important that it takes place in a relaxed environment. That hour and a half is the client's own time, and it's all about them. In the case of online consultations, I usually suggest that the client retreats to a separate small room where they can be comfortable. In a face-to-face consultation, I welcome everyone with a cup of tea or coffee and we start working together in a homely environment.

A consultation may consist of the following services and activities:
* Self-knowledge coaching with spiritual techniques for a full hour. I will assess my client's life areas to the best of my ability and together we will examine where there may be a blockage, a decision situation that may have caused the client to become emotionally unstable and in need of a confirmation, an absolute objective help. The work is done using numerology, Gypsy and Lenormand cards.
* Personalised colour analysis, colour interpretation. This method gives us a deeper picture of what is going on inside us subconsciously and on the surface, on the level of thought. Colours can be a great help in our everyday life, not only in clothing and decoration, but also in spiritual and self-awareness work. A great inner transformation can be brought about with the support of colours, which after a while can also be seen in the way we wear our clothes. After all, if we feel good inside, it will radiate outwards.
* I am currently still in the process of professional development in the background, but soon it will be available for all guests to receive energetic cleansing, transforming belief systems and deep blocks and obstructive thought patterns using the Spiritual Response Therapy (SRT).

I have years of experience in all the techniques and methods listed above. I combine them, build on each other, but what is even more important is that I give my heart and soul to my dear guests, who can always feel at home, wherever they are: far away or close to me.


#### What is colour analysis exactly?

I once decided to colour my life by delving into the world of colour. Through much study, research and experience, I realised that I could help others. I have mastered a method to help us uncover what is going on in our souls and what we have been carrying with us for so long on our journey. Sometimes our souls are just waiting for confirmation, to finally say what we may have suspected but not taken seriously, even though the feeling is already there, almost shouting. The colours show it.

In everyday life, I simply let my soul tell me which colour I need. I feel that we can have a strong relationship with colour, if we just take the time to get to know it. If one is calling to you, but has never played a role in your life before, it means it's time to make a change, to add another colour to your day. They are part of our evolution, so it's worth watching ourselves to see which one appeals to us at each stage of our life, or during a major life change. Each of our chapters has its own colour scheme that takes us to the next.

And how can I help you with all this? All it takes is the creation of a light, playful, yet intuitive colouring. With the help of a web app my partner developed, this can be done remotely and based on the feedback so far, it absolutely works. I produce personalised colour analyses of the completed colouring in Hungarian and English. We can then discuss the message and suggestion of your colours and where you are at the moment spiritually, mentally and physically at an appointment, which takes about an hour and a half. The analysis itself will be emailed to you at the end of the consultation for you to read at any time. After all, there is too much information in such an analysis and not everything is remembered. Some of the messages may not be really understood until later. It's worth reading it several times, and taking it out of the drawer from time to time, even months later. Self-knowledge is a long-term process that requires persistent work.

Just getting started is difficult, but if we give ourselves the time and energy, we can work wonders. Just give yourself time, that's the most important thing. I only help, the rest is up to your own efforts, your will to change, to understand yourself.

Colouring can also be done remotely using a web application, which can be found [here](https://apps.bolyosaniko.com/coloring){:target="_blank"}.

I am at the disposal of my dear guests with confidence, who can find me in person in England or online through my website. I also undertake inquiries in English, in which case, based on pleasant experiences, the national border is not an obstacle either.
